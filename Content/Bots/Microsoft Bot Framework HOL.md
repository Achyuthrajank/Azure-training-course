# The Microsoft Bot Framework #

---

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

Software bots are everywhere. You probably interact with them every day without realizing it. Bots, especially chat and messenger bots, are changing the way we interact with businesses, communities, and even each other. Thanks to light-speed advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the ready availability of AI services, bots are not only becoming more advanced and personalized, but also more accessible to developers. 

Regardless of the target language or platform, developers building bots face the same challenges. Bots require input and output capabilities. Bots need language and dialog logic. Bots need to be responsive, scalable, and extensible. They need to work cross-platform, and they need to interact with users in a conversational manner and in the language the user chooses. The [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) provides the tools developers need to build, connect, manage, and publish intelligent bots that interact naturally with users using a range of services. 

In this lab, you will create a bot using Visual Studio Code and the Microsoft Bot Framework. Then you will interact with the bot using Skype â€” one of many popular services that bots built with the Microsoft Bot Framework can integrate with.

## Exercise 1: Create an Azure Web App ##

The first step in creating a bot is to provide a location for the bot to be hosted. Azure Web Apps are perfect for hosting bot applications. In this exercise, you will create and configure an Azure Web App.

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) in your browser. If asked to login, do so with your Microsoft Account.

1. Click **+ New**, followed by **Web + Mobile** and then **Web App**.

    ![Creating a new Azure Web App](Images/portal-create-new-web-app.png)

    _Creating a new Azure Web App_

1. Enter a name such as "factbot" (without quotation marks) into the **App name** box. *This name must be unique within Azure, so make sure a green check mark appears next to it.*  Make sure **Create new** is selected under **Resource Group** and enter the resource-group name "BotsResourceGroup" (again, without quotation marks). Then click **Create**.

    ![Configuring a new Web App](Images/portal-configure-new-web-app.png)

    _Configuring a new Web App_

1. Click **Resource Groups** in the ribbon the left, followed by **BotsResourceGroup** to open the resource group created for the Web App.

    ![Opening the resource group](Images/portal-open-resource-group.png)

    _Opening the resource group_

1. Wait until **Last deployment** changes from "Deploying" to "Succeeded" indicating your Web App has been successfully deployed.

	> You may need to refresh the page in your browser from time to time to see the most recent deployment status.

    ![Successful deployment](Images/portal-app-deployment-status.png)

    _Successful deployment_

Your Azure Web App is now provisioned and ready to host a bot. The URL of the Web App is http://*appname*.azurewebsites.net, where *appname* is the name you entered for the Web App in Step 3 (for example, http://factbot.azurewebsites.net). If you would like, you can type the URL into your browser's address bar and see the placeholder page that was created for the app.

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
## Exercise 2: Register a bot ##

The next step in building a bot is registering it with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Among other things, the registration process lets the Microsoft Bot Framework know where to find your bot on the Web, and it generates an app ID that uniquely identifies your bot as well as an app password that facilitates access to it.

1. Open the [Microsoft Bot Framework portal](https://dev.botframework.com/) in your browser. If you are not signed in, click **Sign in** in the upper-right corner and sign in with your Microsoft Account.

1. Click **Register a bot** in the menu at the top of the page.

    ![Registering a bot](Images/bot-registering-bot.png)

    _Registering a bot_

1. In the "Bot profile" section, type "Factbot" (without quotation marks) in the **Name** field. Type a bot handle such as "Factbot" into the **Bot handle** field, and enter a brief description of your bot into the **Description** field.
	
    ![Registering a bot profile](Images/bot-bot-registration-01.png)

    _Registering a bot profile_

1. Scroll down to the "Configuration" section and in the **Messaging endpoint** field, enter the value below, replacing *appname* with the Azure Web App name you entered in Exercise 1, Step 3. Then click the **Create Microsoft App ID and password** button.

	<pre>https://<i>appname</i>.azurewebsites.net/api/messages</pre>

	> Bot messaging endpoints can only communicate over secure protocols. Observe that the messaging endpoint URL uses HTTPS rather than HTTP.

    ![Configuring a bot messaging endpoint](Images/bot-bot-registration-02.png)

    _Configuring a bot messaging endpoint_

1. An app ID is automatically generated for your bot. Paste the app ID into a text file and save the file so you can easily retrieve the app ID later. Then click **Generate an app password to continue** to create an app password.

    ![Generating an app password](Images/bot-generate-app-secret.png)

    _Generating an app password_

1. Copy the password into same text file in which you stored the app ID, and then save the file. **You will not be able to retrieve this password after this step**, but will be required to use it in a later exercise. Once the password is saved, click **Ok** to dismiss the dialog.

    ![The app password](Images/bot-new-app-secret.png)

    _The app password_
	
1. Click the **Finish and go back to Bot framework** button to return to the bot registration page.
	
1. Check the box at the bottom of the form, and then click the **Register** button. Finish up by clicking **OK** to dismiss the dialog that informs you that your bot was successfully registered.
 
    ![Completing the bot registration](Images/bot-bot-registration-03.png)

    _Completing the bot registration_

1. Leave the ensuing page open in your browser so you can easily return to it later.

    ![Completed bot registration](Images/bot-bot-registration-complete.png)

    _Completed bot registration_
	
Your bot is now registered with the Microsoft Bot Framework. The next step is to implement the bot. For that, you will use Visual Studio Code.

<a name="Exercise3"></a>
## Exercise 3: Set up and configure a bot project ##

If you haven't installed Visual Studio Code, take a moment to do so now. You can download Visual Studio Code from http://code.visualstudio.com. You should also install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) if it isn't already installed. Both products work cross-platform and can be installed on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

> An easy way to determine whether Node.js is installed is to open a terminal window or Command Prompt window and execute a **node -v** command. If the Node.js version number is displayed, then Node.js is installed.

1. Open a terminal window or a Command Prompt window and use an **md** or **mkdir** command to create a directory named "Factbot" in the location of your choice. This is the directory that will hold the source code files for your bot.

1. Use a **cd** command to make the directory that you just created the current directory. Then type the following command to start Visual Studio code in that directory (note the period at the end of the command):

	<pre>code .</pre>

1. In Visual Studio Code's Explorer panel, click the **New File** button to create a new file in the "Factbot" directory. Name the file **app.js**. 

    ![Adding a new file to the project](Images/vs-click-add-new-file.png)

    _Adding a new file to the project_

1. Add the following line of code to **app.js**: 

	```
	console.log("Hello world!");
	```

	Then use the **File -> Save** command (or simply press **Ctrl+S**) to save the file.

1. Open a TERMINAL window in Visual Studio Code by selecting **Integrated Terminal** from the **View** menu. The TERMINAL window will appear at the bottom of your workspace. 

    ![Opening the Integrated Terminal](Images/vs-select-open-terminal.png)

    _Opening the Integrated Terminal_

1. In the TERMINAL window, execute the following command to install the Microsoft Bot Builder SDK:
 
	<pre>npm install --save botbuilder</pre>

1. Now execute this command in the TERMINAL window to install the packages needed to leverage REST-based messaging routes in your code:

	<pre>npm install --save restify</pre>

1. Execute the following command in the TERMINAL window to run the application and output "Hello world!":

	<pre>node app.js</pre>

1. The next step is to generate a bot configuration file and insert the app ID and app password generated in the previous exercise. To begin, click the **Debug** button in the ribbon on the left side of Visual Studio Code.

    ![Opening the debugger](Images/vs-select-debug-tab.png)

    _Opening the debugger_	

1.	Click the **green arrow** at the top of the debugging panel and then select **Node.js** from the drop-down list. A new file named **launch.json** will be created. When prompted to set up the launch configuration file, click **Close**.
	
    ![Creating a new launch file](Images/vs-creating-launch-file.png)

    _Creating a new launch file_	
	
1.	Add the "env" section highlighted below to the "configurations" section of **launch.json**, and include the app ID and app password generated for your bot in Exercise 2.	
	
	![Adding bot registration values](Images/vs-replacing-bot-config-values.png)

    _Adding bot registration values_	

1.	Save your changes to **launch.json**. Then close the file.
	
1.	Click the **Explorer** button on the left, and then click the **New Folder** button to create a new folder named "en" (without quotation marks) in the "Factbot" directory.
	
    ![Adding a new folder](Images/vs-click-add-folder.png)

    _Adding a new folder_	

	> The "en" folder is not required for your bot to work correctly. However, the Bot Builder SDK will display warnings in the Integrated Terminal if a default language folder is not present.

Your bot project is now set up and ready to go. The next step is to write code to provide simple responses to a user from your bot, and then add conversation logic to provide a more meaningful experience.

<a name="Exercise4"></a>
## Exercise 4: Add conversation logic to your bot ##

The entire goal of creating a bot is to have intelligent, automated interactions with users. Now that registration and project setup are complete, you can enhance the code for your bot to make interactions a little richer.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open **app.js** if it isn't already open. Replace the contents of the file with the following JavaScript code:
 
	```javascript
	var builder = require('botbuilder');
	var connector = new builder.ConsoleConnector().listen();
	var bot = new builder.UniversalBot(connector);
	
	bot.dialog('/', [

    function (session) {
        builder.Prompts.text(session, "Hello, and welcome to Factbot! What's your name?");
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.name = results.response;
        builder.Prompts.number(session, "Hi " + results.response + ", before we get started, let me find out a few things about you. How many years have you been coding?"); 
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.yearsCoding = results.response;
        builder.Prompts.choice(session, "What language do you love the most?", ["C#", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Visual FoxPro"]);
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.language = results.response.entity;
        builder.Prompts.choice(session, "What's your favorite midnight snack?", ["Pizza", "Poptarts", "Chicken and waffles", "Kale salad"]);
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.snack = results.response.entity;   
 
        session.send("Okay, I think I've got it " + session.userData.name + 
                    ": You've been writing code for " + session.userData.yearsCoding + " years," +
                    " love to use " + session.userData.language + ", and" +
                    " you prefer " + session.userData.snack + " as a midnight snack.");

    }
	]);

	```

1. Save your changes to **app.js**. Then, In the TERMINAL window, execute the following command to run your bot:

	<pre>node app.js</pre>

1. Type "hello" (without quotation marks) and press **Enter** to wake up your bot. Factbot will now begin a guided conversation.
	
    !["Waking up" the bot](Images/vs-typing-hello.png)

    _"Waking up" the bot_	

1. Answer the questions Factbot prompts you with.
	
	> Bots created with the Microsoft Bot Framework are smart enough to understand variations in your responses. For example, you can type "2", "JavaScript", or "javascript". Factbot will understand that these are the same response.

    ![Interacting with your bot](Images/vs-bot-interaction-01.png)

    _Interacting with your bot_	 

1. Now let's modify Factbot to use an external REST-based API to retrieve random facts. In Visual Studio Code, replace the contents of **app.js** with the following code:
 	
	```JavaScript
	var builder = require('botbuilder');
	var https = require('https');
	
	var connector = new builder.ConsoleConnector().listen();
	var bot = new builder.UniversalBot(connector);
	
	bot.dialog('/', [

    function (session) {
        builder.Prompts.text(session, "Hello, and welcome to Factbot! What's your name?");
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.name = results.response;
        builder.Prompts.number(session, "Hi " + results.response + ", before we get started, let me find out a few things about you. How many years have you been coding?"); 
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.yearsCoding = results.response;
        builder.Prompts.choice(session, "What language do you love the most?", ["C#", "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Visual FoxPro"]);
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.language = results.response.entity;
        builder.Prompts.choice(session, "What's your favorite midnight snack?", ["Pizza", "Poptarts", "Chicken and waffles", "Kale salad"]);
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.snack = results.response.entity;       
        builder.Prompts.confirm(session, "Now that I better understand your personality, would you me to grab a random, interesting fact for you to enjoy?");
    },

    function (session, results) {

        session.userData.action = results.response;

        if (session.userData.action == true) {

            var optionsget = {
            Â Â Â Â host : 'traininglabservices.azurewebsites.net',  Â  
            Â Â Â Â port : 443,
            Â Â Â Â path : '/api/Facts/1',  
            Â Â Â Â method : 'GET'  
            };

            var reqGet = https.request(optionsget, function(res) {            Â Â Â  
            Â Â Â Â res.on('data', function(factResult) {            Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  
            Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â session.send(factResult.toString());
            Â Â Â Â });            Â 
            });
            Â 
            reqGet.end();
            reqGet.on('error', function(e) {
            Â Â Â Â console.error(e);
            });

            session.send(session.userData.name.toUpperCase() + ", DID YOU KNOW:");
        }
        else {
            session.send("Okay, I think I've got it " + session.userData.name + 
                     ": You've been writing code for " + session.userData.yearsCoding + " years," +
                     " love to use " + session.userData.language + ", and" +
                     " you prefer " + session.userData.snack + " as a midnight snack.");
                      
        }
    }
	]);
	```

1. Save your changes to **app.js**. In the TERMINAL window, press **Ctrl+C** to terminate the running **app.js** file. Then start the modified bot using the following command:

	<pre>node app.js</pre>

1. Type "hello" (without quotation marks) and press **Enter** to wake up your bot. Answer the questions it presents to you. When Factbot asks "would you like me to grab a random, interesting fact for you to enjoy," respond by typing "yes" (again, without quotation marks). After a short pause, a random fact will appear in the TERMINAL window.
	
    ![Random fact displayed by Factbot](Images/vs-request-view-fact.png)

    _Random fact displayed by Factbot_	 

In this exercise, you built and tested a functional bot that leverages built-in features of the Microsoft Bot Framework, and added additional code to call an external REST-based API service. The bot is almost ready to be published to Azure. But first, it is prudent to learn how to debug bots in Visual Studio Code.

<a name="Exercise5"></a>
## Exercise 5: Debug your bot ##

The Microsoft Bot Framework supports a number of mechanisms for debugging bots, including the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator/). In this exercise, you will learn how to use Visual Studio code to debug bots by setting breakpoints and stepping through code.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open **launch.json** for editing. Add the "console" property highlighted below, and then save your changes.

    ![Modifying launch.json](Images/vs-open-launch-file.png)

    _Modifying launch.json_	 
  
1. Open **app.js** and add a breakpoint at line 41 by clicking in the margin to the left of the line number.
 
    ![Setting a brekpoint in app.js](Images/vs-set-breakpoint.png)

    _Setting a brekpoint in app.js_ 
  
1. Click the **Debug** button in the ribbon on the left, and then click the **green arrow** to start a debugging session.
 
    ![Starting a debugging session](Images/vs-start-debugging.png)

    _Starting a debugging session_	 
 
1. Type "hello" into the TERMINAL window and press **Enter**. Then answer the bot's questions, and be sure to answer "yes" when asked if you want to see a random fact.
 
1. Visual Studio Code will break on line 41. Hover over any variable or parameter to see its value. Then click the **Step Over** button a few times to step through the code. 
 
    ![Stepping through the code](Images/vs-on-breakpoint.png)

    _Stepping through the code_	 

1. Click the **Stop** button to end the debugging session.
 
    ![Ending a debugging session](Images/vs-click-stop-debugging.png)

    _Ending a debugging session_	

At this point, you have a fully functioning bot. The next step is to publish it to your Azure Web App so it can be used with external applications such as Skype.

<a name="Exercise6"></a>
## Exercise 6: Deploy the bot to Azure ##

In this exercise, you will deploy your bot to the Azure Web App you created earlier, and you will use OneDrive as the deployment source.

1. Return to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and to the resource group named "BotsResourceGroup" you created in Exercise 1.

1. Click the Azure Web App that you provisioned in Exercise 1.

    ![Authorizing OneDrive](Images/portal-authorize.png)

    _Authorizing OneDrive_	

1. Leave the remaining values in the "Deployment source" blade set to the defaults, and then click **OK**. Your bot deployment source has now been configured.
 
    ![Finalizing deployment-source setup](Images/portal-finalize-deployment-source.png)

    _Finalizing deployment-source setup_	

1. Open a browser and go to [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com). If asked to login in, do so with your Microsoft account.

1. In OneDrive's search box, type "Azure Web Apps" (without quotation marks) and select the **Azure Web Apps** folder.
 
    ![Searching OneDrive for the Azure Web Apps deployment folder](Images/onedrive-search.png)

    _Searching OneDrive for the Azure Web Apps deployment folder_	

1. Click the "factbot" folder created for your bot to view the folder's contents. At this point, the folder should be empty.
 
    ![Opening the factbot folder in OneDrive](Images/onedrive-select-factbot-folder.png)

    _Opening the factbot folder in OneDrive_	

1. Click **Upload -> Files**, and browse to the "Resources" folder included with this lab. Select both files in the "Resources" folder and click **Open** to upload the bot to OneDrive.

	> You are uploading a slightly different bot than the one you created because, among other things, this one retrieves the app ID and password from app settings rather than rely on hardcoded values.
 
    ![Uploading to OneDrive](Images/onedrive-upload-files.png)

    _Uploading to OneDrive_	
 
1. Return to the Azure Portal and navigate back to the Web App you configured earlier in this exercise. Click **Deployment options** again. Notice that the blade has now changed to show that deployment will occur from OneDrive.

	<pre>npm install --save botbuilder</pre>
 
1. Now execute the following command in the console to install the packages required to leverage REST-based messaging routes into your Azure Web App environment:

	<pre>npm install --save restify</pre>

Now that your bot has been written, tested, and deployed to an Azure Web App, the final step is to test it in a connected channel.

<a name="Exercise7"></a>
## Exercise 7: Test the bot ##

Once deployed, bots can be connected to channels such as Skype, Slack, SMS, and Facebook Messenger, where you can interact with them the way you would interact with any other user. In this exercise, you will test your bot with Skype. If Skype isn't already installed on your computer, please install it now. You can download Skype for Windows, macOS, and Linux from https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/.

1. Return to the [Microsoft Bot Framework portal](https://dev.botframework.com/) and open the bot that you registered earlier. Locate the "Test connection to your bot" panel and click the **Test** button. Verify that the word "Accepted" appears, indicating that the test was successful.
 
    ![Testing the connection to your bot](Images/bot-test-connection.png)

    _Testing the connection to your bot_
 
1. Locate the "Channels" panel and click **Edit** in the row for the Skype channel.
 
    ![Editing the Skype bot channel](Images/bot-edit-skype-channel.png)

    _Editing the Skype bot channel_

1. Ensure that **Enable Factbot on Skype** is toggled ON and click **Iâ€™m done configuring** at the bottom of the page. Your bot is now ready to test in a Skype conversation.
 
    ![Configuring the Skype bot channel](Images/bot-configure-skype.png)

    _Configuring the Skype bot channel_
	
1. Click the **Add to Skype** button.
 
    ![Adding Factbot to Skype](Images/bot-click-add-to-skype.png)

    _Adding Factbot to Skype_
	
1.  Click **Add to Contacts** to add the bot as a Skype contact. After a short delay, Skype will launch and display a new conversation thread between you and the bot. 
  
	> If Skype does not automatically add Factbot to a conversation, select the bot from the "Recent" list in Skype to initiate a conversation manually.
  
    ![Adding Factbot to your Skype contacts](Images/skype-add-to-contacts.png)

    _Adding Factbot to your Skype contacts_
	
1. Start a conversation with Factbot by typing "Hello" into the Skype window. After a short delay, Factbot will begin the guided conversation you experienced in Exercise 4. Continue the conversation all the way to the end to see a random and interesting fact! 
 
    ![Conversing with Factbot via Skype](Images/skype-guided-conversation.png)

    _Conversing with Factbot via Skype_

You now have a fully functioning bot, created with the Microsoft Bot Framework, available for anyone in the world to use. You may have noticed there are many other channels to choose from as well. Feel free to plug your bot into other channels and test it in different scenarios. 

<a name="Summary"></a>
## Summary ##

In this hands-on lab you learned how to:

There is much more that you can do to leverage the power of the Microsoft Bot Framework by incorporating [dialogs](http://aihelpwebsite.com/Blog/EntryId/9/Introduction-To-Using-Dialogs-With-The-Microsoft-Bot-Framework), [FormFlow](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/07/14/building-a-microsoft-bot-using-microsoft-bot-framework-using-formflow/), and [Microsoft Language Understanding and Intelligence Services (LUIS)](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/guides/understanding-natural-language/). With these and other features, you can build sophisticated bots that respond to users' queries and commands and interact in a fluid, conversational, and non-linear manner.
