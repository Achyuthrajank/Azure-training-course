# Introduction: Creating Your Azure Account and Using the Azure Portal #

---

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

Signing up for an free trial Azure account is simple and allows you to get started in a couple of minutes. Access to your Azure account is done through a [Microsoft Account](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/sign-in-what-is-microsoft-account). In the Azure for Research initiative the Azure accounts you are being given only work with a Microsof Account. If your organization or school is using [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/) (AAD) through [Office 365](https://products.office.com/en-us/business/explore-office-365-for-business) or your school [Office 365 in Education](https://products.office.com/en-US/student/office-in-education?tab=schools&legRedir=true&CorrelationId=acc65b7c-0893-48f2-818d-f4bb41ab7ff7 you cannot use that account.

Like any modern cloud-based service, Azure is changing and growing all the time. The entry point to Azure is through the Azure Portal. The new modern portal is the one you are going to use, but it is in the process of being finished so is sometimes called the Preview Portal. The original portal, called the Classic Portal, still has features that have not been ported over to the Preview Portal. Each of the hands on labs you will cover have explicit steps showing which features are in which portal but it is important to know how to switch portals.
